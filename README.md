# lanime
A terminal anime client that uses 4anime as source.

## Current Features
lanime can currently search for your desired anime and provide you a list of anime based on your search, and also provide episodes and their relevant watch links. Currently it cannot play anime in your terminal :(

## Installation

```

### 2. move to the directory

```sh
cd lanime
```

this should handle the dependencies (and the dependencies' dependencies) for you and give you a go ahead message if everything went right

## Usage
